Sencha demo to create two simple associations:

  * Define a User model that has many items
  * Define an Item model that belongs to a user

This demo is simple because it puts all the code in this one file,
and creates the associations step-by-step in plain JavaScript.

In a real-world Sencha application we would use Sencha's powerful
proxy associations that have belongsTo, hasMany, and nested loading.

This demo is based on the Sencha tutorials and documentation.
